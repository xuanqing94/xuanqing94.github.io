Hi! I'm a second year PhD student of [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), advised by [Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~chohsieh/rf/). Prior to that, I received my B.S. at [School of Physics](http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/English.html), [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2016 (thesis advisor: [Qite Li](http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/~liqt/index.html)). Before graduation, I was a research intern studing natural language processing, advised by [Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home). Currently my reseach interests are optimization problems in machine learning, robust neural networks and generative modeling, specifically:

+ Convex/non-convex optimization algorithms for efficient machine learning
+ Robust neural networks
+ Efficient learning of generative models
